TODO:

- [X] Make DestroyWindow queue a window destruction instead of doing the dirty work. really the only thing doing the drawing should be the main window manager task
- Disallow typing into two textinput controls at the same time

VBuilder:
- Allow resizing of existing controls
- Allow changing properites such as text
- Allow exporting to C or something, typical code which can be slammed down into an EVENT_CREATE.
- Allow more complex controls such as images, icons etc
- (Big Boss) Allow execution of CScript code (potentially with just one engine instead of generating one per event, this way we can have variables that are constant. Not sure how I'll get this to work
