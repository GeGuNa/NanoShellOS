To create a new application, simply copy one of the folders, rename it and change the makefile to output a .nse with that filename.
It's optional to use the same filename as the directory your application is in... unless you decide to use `make_all.sh` from the root,
which assumes that all executables are named the same as the directory's name, as in `apps/<AppName>/<AppName>.nse`.
