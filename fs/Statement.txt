Hello, world!
I am typing some really long text that should eventually hit a cluster boundary maybe?

I'll slam some text in here:
- Bri'ish people talking about how terrible the Chinese Social Credit system is
- Tesco ClubCard

- No Switches?

- System
- Notebook
- Documents
- Scribble

- *System*
- The System program contains system configuration and install options, plus a shutdown option.
- Arrange windows:
- Windowed
- SmartSnap

- Home

- Windows Photo Viewer can't display this picture because there might not be enough memory available on your computer.  Close some programs that you aren't using or free some hard disk space (if it's almost full) and then try again.
